    """
    Asynchronous websocket client implementation.
    
    Inherits common websocket features from the ``WebSocketCommonProtocol`` class.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    _at_eof : `bool`
        Whether the protocol received end of file.
    _chunks : `deque` of `bytes`
        Right feed, left pop queue, used to store the received data chunks.
    _exception : `None`, `BaseException`
        Exception set by ``.set_exception``, when an unexpected exception occur meanwhile reading from socket.
    _loop : ``EventThread``
        The event loop to what the protocol is bound to.
    _offset : `int`
        Byte offset, of the used up data of the most-left chunk.
    _paused : `bool`
        Whether the protocol's respective transport's reading is paused. Defaults to `False`.
        
        Also note, that not every transport supports pausing.
    _payload_reader : `None`, `GeneratorType`
        Payload reader generator, what gets the control back, when data, eof or any exception is received.
    _payload_waiter : `None` of ``Future``
        Payload waiter of the protocol, what's result is set, when the ``.payload_reader`` generator returns.
        
        If cancelled or marked by done or any other methods, the payload reader will not be cancelled.
    _transport : `None`, `Any`
        Asynchronous transport implementation. Is set meanwhile the protocol is alive.
    _drain_waiter : `None`, ``Future``
        A future, what is used to block the writing task, till it's writen data is drained.
    _drain_lock : ``Lock``
        Asynchronous lock to ensure, that only `1` frame is written in `1` time.
    close_code : `int`
        The websocket's close code if applicable. Defaults to `0`.
    close_connection_task : `None`, ``Task`` of ``.close_connection``
        A task, what is present meanwhile the websocket is closing to avoid race condition.
    close_timeout : `float`
        The maximal duration in seconds what is waited for response after close frame is sent. Defaults to `10.0`.
    close_reason : `None`, `str`

        received tho.
    connection_lost_waiter : ``Future``
